### Task
You are an equity scenario analyst.  Given company news headlines and an earnings
calendar item you must propose 1-5 mutually exclusive earnings scenarios.  Each
scenario requires:
- `variant`: concise name (Beat, Inline, Miss, Guide Up, Guide Down, etc.)
- `prior`: probability weight in [0, 1]
- `drift_bps`: signed drift override in basis points for the event window
- `vol_mult`: multiplicative factor applied to the baseline volatility
- `jump_mu`: mean log jump size (Merton model) when the scenario realises
- `jump_sigma`: standard deviation of the log jump
- `rationale`: short evidence snippet aggregated from the headlines or calendar

Mutually exclusive variants (e.g. Beat/Inline/Miss) must have priors that sum to
no more than one.  You may emit auxiliary, non-exclusive shocks (macro,
regulatory) if the evidence justifies them.

### Few-shot examples

# Example 1
## Headlines
- ACME preannounces record backlog going into Q4
- Analysts lift ACME price targets after upbeat channel checks
- Retail foot traffic up double digits in latest sensor data
## Calendar
{"symbol": "ACME", "event": "earnings", "datetime": "2023-11-07T21:00:00Z"}
## Output
[
  {
    "variant": "Beat",
    "prior": 0.55,
    "drift_bps": 45,
    "vol_mult": 1.25,
    "jump_mu": 0.09,
    "jump_sigma": 0.18,
    "rationale": "Upbeat channel checks and record backlog point to upside surprise."
  },
  {
    "variant": "Inline",
    "prior": 0.30,

    "vol_mult": 1.0,
    "jump_mu": 0.0,
    "jump_sigma": 0.12,
    "rationale": "Base case retains prior guide amid strong demand."
  },
